# workstation-connecting-to-domain
This script will create a connection from local computer to a server domain.

This script will connect your local computer to wanted domain. In this case, we know the DNS address of the server and will match the settings with the server. The script will also use the servers admin credentials (where this script is about to connect) from a .txt file. Lastly the settings for Network Discovery & File and Printer Sharing will be set to visible.
